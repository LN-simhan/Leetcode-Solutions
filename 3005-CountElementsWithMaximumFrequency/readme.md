# 3005. Count Elements With Maximum Frequency

You are given an array <code>nums</code> consisting of <b>positive</b> integers.

Return the <b><i>total frequencies</i></b> of elements in <code>nums</code> such that those elements all have the <b><i>maximum</i></b> frequency.

The <b>frequency</b> of an element is the number of occurrences of that element in the array.

## Example 1:
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> nums = [1,2,2,3,1,4]
<b>Output:</b> 4
<b>Explanation:</b> The elements 1 and 2 have a frequency of 2 which is the maximum frequency in the array.
So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 4.
</pre>

## Example 2:
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
<b>Output:</b> 5
<b>Explanation:</b> All elements of the array have a frequency of 1 which is the maximum.
So the number of elements in the array with maximum frequency is 5.
</pre>

## Constraints:
<pre>
1 <= nums.length <= 100
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
</pre>
