# 101. Symmetric Tree

Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

## Example 1:
<img src="symtree1.jpg" width=300>
<pre>
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true
</pre>

## Example 2:
<img src="symtree2.jpg" width=300>
<pre>
Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false
</pre>

---

## Constraints:
<pre>
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
</pre>

Follow up: Could you solve it both recursively and iteratively?
